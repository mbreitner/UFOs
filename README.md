# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage that displays the data I collected regarding UFO sightings. The data is displayed in a table and has insights from respected Ufologists. I wanted users to be able to input specific filter criteria to help them update the table and find the results they wanted. 

### Results
To perform a search and update the table, simply scroll down to the table and navigate to the "Filter Search" section of the page.

Once in this section, input which ever filter is most relevant to your search. You can filter the table results by date, city, state, country, and even shape. The user can input one or more filters at the same time. 

Here you can see the table is now filtered for sightings in the city of el cajon and the shape was a light.

### Summary
A drawback of this webpage is the inability to save a search and come back to it at a later date. The filters will automatically go back to the default once the page refreshes.

Two additional recommendations I would have is 1. Making it possible so the filters can work with approximate matches instead of exact matches e.g. "cajon" instead of "el cajon" and 2. Adding in an export button so the user can use the data outside of the site as well.
